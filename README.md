The Garmin web page (https://connect.garmin.com) display traning activities only one by one.
With this notebook a list of activities can be displayed on one page as shown here.

I use this depiction to get an overview of several acitivities in one area, e.g. bike tours during a trip. Here it is easy to plan a further tour to places not yet visited.
